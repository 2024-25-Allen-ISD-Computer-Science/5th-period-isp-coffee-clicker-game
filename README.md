We aim to make a clicker game that draws inspiration from the original cookie-clicker game. In this process, we will have to make up all of the individual aspects of this game. examples of this are; settings, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), layout, buttons, resources, buildings, upgrades, achievements items, shinies, and general concepts. these general concepts will include the description, text, icon, tags, and cost.
